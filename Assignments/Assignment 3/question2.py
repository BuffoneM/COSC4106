# COSC4106 Assignment 3 : Question 2
#
# A contractor is given a list of n jobs. Each job takes exactly one hour to finish. 
# Each job ji has a profit pi (pi  > 0) and a deadline di (1 <= di <= n).  The 
# profit is earned only if the job is completed by the deadline. Design and implement 
# a greedy algorithm to create a job schedule that maximizes the profit.  A job 
# schedule is a list of the selected jobs in the order they should be completed. A 
# job should not be selected if the contractor cannot complete it before the deadline.
